## Open Source Libraries

This project makes use of [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries) to display a
list of used open source dependencies and their licenses within the app.

In order to keep this information up-to-date, the following gradle task has to be run after
changing a dependency:

```
app:exportLibraryDefinitions
```
